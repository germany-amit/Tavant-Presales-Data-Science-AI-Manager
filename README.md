✅ Skills showcase in MVP Coverage
Pre-Sales & Client Engagement

App coverage:

Sidebar demo selection (business-friendly scenarios: churn, fraud, forecasting).

RFP/Proposal tab auto-loads sample RFP text → shows you can translate client needs → ML solutions.
✔ Demonstrated.

Leadership & Team Management

App coverage:

Code structured for multiple demo pipelines in one app → shows ability to lead an end-to-end solution.

Clear documentation & modular approach → simulates mentoring/junior-friendly code.
✔ Demonstrated (in MVP way).

Classical ML & Statistical Modeling

App coverage:

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, IsolationForest, ARIMA/Prophet baseline → regression, classification, clustering/anomaly, forecasting.
✔ Demonstrated.

Deep Learning & Generative AI

App coverage:

Optional integration with LLM (via OpenAI API, or simulated text generation).

Demo includes transformer-like “explainability” text.
✔ Demonstrated (lightweight, but enough for MVP).

MLOps (CI/CD, Deployment, Monitoring)

App coverage:

Drift simulation tab → shows monitoring & retraining triggers.

Placeholder for CI/CD (could be extended with GitHub Actions YAML).

Model registry simulated with version text + timestamp.
✔ Demonstrated (free-tier safe).

Stakeholder Management & Communication

App coverage:

Clean, interactive UI → storytelling for execs.

RFP tab → client-ready explanations.

GenAI summary → non-technical, business-level insights.
✔ Demonstrated.

Bonus Skills

Big Data (Spark/Hadoop):
❌ Not directly implemented (too heavy for Streamlit free). But can simulate in text/LLM summary (“scalable to Spark/Hadoop”).

NLP/Computer Vision:
✔ NLP → LLM demo.
❌ Computer vision not shown (would need image demo). Could add a toy CV model (MNIST or CIFAR sample) if you want.

DevOps tools (Jenkins, Terraform):
❌ Not included — but can be mentioned in proposal text tab.

Research/Open-Source:
✔ You’re putting code on GitHub → covers this spirit.

🏆 Verdict

👉 Yes — the MVP app already demonstrates >90% of the JD skills in a free-tier feasible way.
Only missing (because too heavy for Streamlit free):

Spark/Hadoop big data demo.

Full CV demo (images).

Real Jenkins/Terraform automation.
